# Undead Delta

7 Days to Die alpha 20 mod adding new crafting items, changing some user interface and more. This mod is still under
heavy development, if you wanted to use this mod right now, you can use `develop` branch.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Before you install this mod, I recommend you to see the `changelog.md` first, so you will know what this mod does on
**7 Days to Die Vanilla**. For your information, I was not testing this with other mod yet, so i did not know if this
mod compatible with other mod or not.

1. Find your 7 Days to Die game folder (If you are install it on steam, it should be
   in `C:\Program Files (x86)/steam/steamapps/common/7 Days to Die`).
2. Once you inside in this folder, go to called `Mods` (**create one if not exists and it MUST have capital 'M' to
   work**).
3. Create new directory called `UndeadDelta` and paste everything inside this repo into that folder.
4. Start the game.
